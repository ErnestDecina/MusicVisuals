# Instructions to work Visualizer

## Step 1

	Make sure to be on a connected network that has a DNS that doesnt block the following domain name: ernestjohndecina.com

## Step 2

	Run the project using F5 (With Debugging) || CTRL + F5 (Without Debugging)

## Step 3

	Enter an APPROPRIATE prompt. Then wait for the Application to process your AI Generated Image. (Any inappropriate prompts will be met with a error and user must reinput a prompt). If it still doesnt work make sure you are connected to the internet for visualizer to create a AI Image

# How it works

## Setup in Main

In main we create a MusicVisual Instance inside the static function startMusicVisualizer.

## Running the Music Visualizer instance
### First running Constructor
The constructor will first will create a ArrayList of type VisualAbstractClass called visualList
### Secondly Setups works
Colour mode is then set to RGB
We then lock the FPS to 60
Then we call the function loadSong to load the song into the MusicVisual
and Finally we call loadVisuals this function creates instances and adds them into the visualList

###  Thirdly settings
Then this function is called and the window size is set.

## Draw Function
This function will be called every frame and it calls
background(0) this is to reset the frame then
### playVisuals runs
Then running this function first gets the current time, and divides current time then compares it with an array of timings, if it is greater than then we increment timingsCounter.
Timings counter determines the visual we are playing then.

We chose to this implementation as it is more efficient than multiple if statments.

Then the Visual that is returned we render that image

#### Visual 3 (Daniel Wu: )


#### Visual 2 (Ernest John Decina: C21394933)
##### render function
Like Music Visualizer there is a timing counter in this visual called drawObjectsIndex.

###### changeDrawObject
this will count cnad check if we need to change the visual similar to MusicVisualizer

###### drawObjects.get(drawObjectsIndex).render();
This will import the 

#### Visual 4 (Alex Tsang: )


#### Visual 1 (Ron Pingol: )

Each team member or individual needs to write a paragraph or two explaining what they contributed to the project

- What they did
- What they are most proud of
- What they learned

## Visual Dimension 1: Ron Pingol (C21782059)

### Desc
	
	My visual consists of multiple shapes that make up multiple rings then transitioning into a cube filled dimesnion, looking like the tesseract area in the movie 	Interstellar
	
### Part 1

	Multiple coloured shapes will be moving and they will be rotating on a ring.
	
### Part 2

	My Second visual, will transition from the multicoloured shaped. Then lots and lots (like lots), of cubes will appear and when they rotate their colours will change.

## Ron Pingol ()

	This was a difficult assignment as i have never done processing before and learning these things all in one semester was a very tough task. i am proud of drawing my shapes, it made me learn alot of new methods and has opened my eyes to the more art aspect of coding.
	
```    private void drawCubeField() {
        pApplet.rotateX(angle / 30.0f);
        pApplet.rotateY(angle * 1.3f / 30.0f);
        pApplet.rotateZ(angle * 0.7f / 30.0f);
        pApplet.noStroke();
        fft.forward(audioBuffer);
        for (int i = 0; i < numBands; i++) {
            bandSize[i] = fft.getBand(i) * 5;
        }
        angle += PApplet.map(bandSize[0], 0, 100, 0.01f, 0.1f);
        colorAngle += PApplet.map(bandSize[1], 0, 100, 0.001f, 0.01f);
        for (int i = -200; i < 200; i += 20) {
            for (int j = -200; j < 200; j += 20) {
                for (int k = -200; k < 200; k += 20) {
                    float x = i;
                    float y = j;
                    float z = k;
                    float size = PApplet.map(bandSize[(i + 200) / 20], 0, 255, 0, 50);
                    float yOffset = pApplet.noise(i * noiseScale, j * noiseScale, k * noiseScale) * noiseStrength;
                    // Assign a different color for each cube based on its position
                    int cubeColor = pApplet.color(PApplet.map(i + colorAngle, 0, 512, 0, 255),
                            PApplet.map(j + colorAngle, 0, 512, 0, 255),
                            PApplet.map(k + colorAngle, 0, 512, 0, 255));
                    pApplet.fill(cubeColor);
                    pApplet.pushMatrix();
                    pApplet.translate(x, y + yOffset, z);
                    pApplet.box(size);
                    pApplet.popMatrix();
                }
            }
        }
    }

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
